<h1>About the Author</h1>


<p>My name is Mélanie Péron. I come from a tiny village barely visible on a map. I am not Jewish.  None of my relatives was a victim of the Holocaust. My grandparents were not in the Resistance. They did not save any one from the Holocaust.</p>

<p>Yet, I created a course on Paris during the German Occupation, applied and received the Lori Rutman Teaching Fellowship. Then, with the support of the USC Shoah Foundation and the Penn Price Lab for Digital Humanities, I developed a multimedia map of Parisduring WWIIand now a website.</p>

<h2>BLANK A– Why would I explore a time from a past I did not experience? </h2>

<p>To answer this question, I turned to my primary signifier. Could my name lead me to the liminal moment when it all started or should I saythe threshold, as my name actually means in French if you add an extra [r]? A quick Google search conjuresup a frightening web connecting my name to ...anti-Semitism. René Péron was the illustrator of the infamous poster <i>The Jew and France.</i> Perón, with a displaced accenton the [o], takes us to the Argentinian leader who financed the escape of key architects of the Holocaust. Pèron, with an inverted accenton the [e], means pillory in old French. <i>Au Pilori</i> was the most virulent anti-Semitic weekly paper during the Occupation.</p>

<p>My place of birth only reinforces the rooting of my origins into the wrong side of history. I was born 30 kms away from Beaune-la-Rolande, 50 kms away from Pithiviers. Both towns became known for their internment camps where thousands of Jews – a lot of whom were children- transited before being deported to Auschwitz. Growing up, for the longest time, I only knew that a Pithiviers was a cake, specialty of the town bearing the same name. </p>

<p>Maybe this is where it all started. </p>

<h2>BLANK B – My grandmother’s apron</h2>

<img class="img-single" src="/assets/images/about_author/GrandMotherMelanie.png"></img>


<p>My grandmother was a peasant. One about whom books do not talk much. She worked like a man, ran the farm and raised 2 young daughters while her husband was a war prisoner in Czechoslovakia for 5 years. A woman of few words, she always remembered to make everyone’s favorite dish when they came visit, to plant all of her grandchildren’s favorite fruits in the garden, to take us on long bike rides finding the best tree under which to take a nap. She got up hours before everyone else, put on her meticulously ironed apron and silently got everything ready. She lived backstage, in her charismatic husband’s shadow. She never talked about her past. She never talked about her feelings. She never talked about her dreams. No one asked her about them anyway. She was just <i>there</i> for us, her “little ones” (<i>mes petits</i>) as she called us. </p>

<p>Sometimes, she would go to my grandfather’s office and close the door. Once I hid and saw her take a key from under a book and open the cabinet. She pulled out a folder, sat and cried repeating “these poor little ones”. After she left, I took the key, opened the cabinet and looked at the papers. They were newspaper clippings about the camps in Pithiviers and Beaune-la-Rolande. I never said anything to her about it. </p>

<p>Maybe this is where it all started. </p>

<h2>BLANK C -  Louise.</h2>


<p>My grandmother eventually had Alzheimer’s. My name and my face were the only ones she remembered. Her body was broken and took the shape of an inverted L. When she walked, her gaze could only stare at the floor. She filled the pocket of her apron with all sorts of little rocks she would find on the ground and inspect them before going to sleep. As she would painfully try to put her finger on what was inevitably ending on the tip of her tongue, I decided to appease her ordeal and stopped using words to talk to her. We communicated with gestures and looks.  I had so many questions for her but she had no words for me. What she had for me though, apart from the little rocks she would leave on my bed, was this bright complicit light in her eyes when she looked at me.  My relatives only talk about her blank stare. We evidently did not live in the same story. </p>
